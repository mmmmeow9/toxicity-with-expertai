      " This is my first time on wikipedia and I have not found how to make my own comments page so I am putting the comment here I just changed the piece on hierocracy because I ve never heard it used as a synonym for theocracy and it has its own perfectly clear meaning in the work of Weber which has been widely adopted I suspect that whoever wrote that bit had no idea what he was talking about I find the whole entry for theocracy completely unsatisfactory starting with the definition Again it reads as if the writers had no idea about the subject and have it confused with several other topics I think it would be hopeless to try to repair the page by successive edits It needs to start with a proper definition of theocracy that distinguishes theocracy from caesaropapism and clearly says that a pious society is NOT by definition a theocracy and also that church establishment is not compatible with theocracy but is compatible with caesaropapism Theocracy is a form of government not a social quality it can be defined as a government in which the persons and institutions of the religious order either control or replace the organs of the civil government Sen McGlinn Church and State page 243 Then it is clear that Iran is a theocracy Saudi Arabia is not and so on through all the other questions discussed here The problem is a vague and too broad definition at the outset One should rather start with a clear and hard definition and later note that in popular usage the term has become an almost meaningless pejoritive applied to religion in public places Can somebody enlighten me about how one goes about fixing the page One obvious step would be to ask for input via the editors of the Journal of Church and State Baylor University they have a research school on this topic Email me at Sen sonja at Casema NL Sen McGlinn \n",

      "Topics The Holocaust Anne Frank Diary Change of the Freedom Writers The Holocaust The holocaust occurred during World War II when Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany The holocaust is basically when millions of Jews were murdered during WWII and were intensely discriminated by Hitler and the Nazi 檚 However many of the Jews had resided in parts of Europe and many of them were residing in Germany but many of them were once again murdered by the Germans because Hitler plotted on disappearing all the Jews that were in the country This reminds me of how Ms Gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the Holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event But some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did Therefore a network of over 40 000 facilities in Germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate hold and kill Jews and other victims In addition after the beginning of WWII the Nazi 檚 began ordering Jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them weren t allowed to leave at all Also many of the Jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the Nazis or they will have to face death but the Jews faced death anyways and about 5 million children were also killed during the holocaust due to Hitler 檚 orders Also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than 5 million non Jewish victims living in Germany during WWII and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas In addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the Jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps and the majority of all Jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they weren t respected and treated kindly by the Germans and especially Hitler Also the Jews were the scapegoats of Germany collapsing after WWI meaning that the Nazi 檚 blame the Jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and Germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country Anne Frank Diary Anne Frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the Holocaust She was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary I believe that she had a messenger to tell her what was going on outside Anne Frank was born in June 12 1929 in Frankfurt Germany She was born as a Jew and bringing a Jew was a very bad thing in the 1920 檚 because it was during World War I She was hiding because herself and her family didn t want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place I don 檛 understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family that didn t do anything wrong Why hurt the Jews What did they do to get killed Change of the Freedom Writers Should It 檚 amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded From a group of students who didn t care about school and becoming someone important in life to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story They didn t care about school they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach Many of them graduated from colleges others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School The reason why is because it was then when it all started From failing ditching class gang violence poverty and other domestic violence at home to SUCCESS For the most part most of them are doing very well They are teachers professors and other important positions someone can have They are living the toast of change Links http www firststreetconfidential com images images history 0921 the holocaust jpg http www annefrank org en Anne Frank http images publicradio org content 2009 08 12 20090812_anne_frank_33 jpg http www the trades com article php id 5438\n",

      " Supreme Commander 2nd April 2015 Hi Sorry if I m doing this wrong but I m not familiar with the way discussions are handled in Wikipedea You deleted a modification I made to the Supreme Commander article which I disagree with Diff link https en wikipedia org w index php title Supreme_Commander_ 28video_game 29 diff 653602714 oldid 653594367 I replaced a link to the discontinued official website with a link to the fansite that currently supports the game You subsequently deleted my modification and replaced it with a link to the Wayback Machine page that attempts to load the old official website I don t think your modification is an improvement Everytime I ve tried it the Wayback Machine page you ve linked either loads a blank page or reports an error in Robots txt it s never once loaded an actual archived page Tested in Firefox 35 0 1 and IE8 64bit The fansite I linked is currently the hub for the entire Supreme Commander communty It is the only remaining source of bugfix patches and it is the only multiplayer matchmaking lobby for the game which averages a population of 800 1000 members nightly and thousands of matches played For someone visiting this article for information on Supreme Commander I think they will get far more value from the link that I posted than from the one you posted I ve looked at the Wiki article guidelines and I don t see anything that prohibits fansite links for games that are no longer officially supported This game isn t just no longer supported the producer has actually gone out of business I note that the article on the original Elite contains links to both the FrontierAstero website and the Elite Wiki at alioth net both of which are fan maintained resources \n",

      " The whole concept of blocking and banning is an anachronistic tribal practice that not only predates the advent of the Rule of Law it s the very subject of the first three laws ever carved onto stone tablets some 3750 years ago Hammurabi of Mesopotamia These are the first three laws in their entirety of the Code of Hammurabi translated into English 1 If any one ensnare another putting a ban upon him but he can not prove it then he that ensnared him shall be put to death 2 If any one bring an accusation against a man and the accused go to the river and leap into the river if he sink in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house But if the river prove that the accused is not guilty and he escape unhurt then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser 3 If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders and does not prove what he has charged he shall if it be a capital offense charged be put to death The second law seems bizarre by modern standards It appears to be the source of the dismissive phrase Go jump in the lake Compare to the Yiddish expression Nem zich a vaneh Go take a bath Go jump in the lake There are 282 such laws in the Code of Hammurabi each no more than a sentence or two The 282 laws are bracketed by a pukeworthy Prologue in which Hammurabi introduces himself and a narcissistic Epilogue in which he affirms his authority and sets forth his hopes and prayers for his code of laws Note that Wikipedia is not even as evolved as Hammurabi since Wikipedia does not even do the level of due process required of Hammurabi s first law Given that Wikipedia has adopted an anachronistic pre Hammurabic tribalistic ochlocracy that does not even rise to the level of the Code of Hammurabi is it any wonder that Wikipedia is the venue of recurring classic liminal social drama that reprises the oldest stories in the annals of human history Hammurabi s notion was to advise everyone to go jump in the lake when they are tainted with an unproven allegation I reckon the secular cultural practice of absolution through ablution inspired the Early Morning Baptisers of Qumran to co opt Hammurabi s Remedy into the Mikvah Ritual Bath Baptismal sin cleansing survives to this day in most Christian denominations Of course there was that interlude in the desert where there were no bodies of holy water so Aaron devised an alternate ritual involving a delightful goat named Caprice I am rather fond of Caprice since her story inspired portions of the Passion of Christ I find it ironic that a site that purports to offer the sum of all human knowledge is still struggling to learn the oldest lessons in the annals of human history So I suggest people wash their hands of Jimbo s anachronistic cult of pre Hammurabic tribalism cleanse themselves of the grit by jumping in the lake and evolving to a more modern and enlightened governance model along the lines suggested by such innovative pioneers as Moses Socrates Buddha Jesus Lao Tsu Maimonides Thomas Becket Stephen Langton Benjamin Franklin Thomas Jefferson Henry David Thoreau Mohandas Gandhi ML King Thich Nhat Hanh John Rawls Father John Dear Barak Obama Kermit the Frog and Barsoom Tork Associates Barsoom Tork \n",
